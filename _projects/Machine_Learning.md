Cool Machine Learning Projects. AI has been really taking off recently with increases in computing power allowing for advances in aspects such a deep learning. The climate community could potentially benefit greatly from including machine learning tools in both analysis and prediction. I'm currently interested in building up my knowledge to implement an AI storm tracking algorithm.
